React Theme Toggle App ðŸŒ—
Overview

This project is a sleek and responsive React application that implements a light/dark theme toggle using React's Context API and Hooks. It provides an intuitive user interface where users can seamlessly switch between light and dark modes with a smooth toggle button, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

The app demonstrates:

    Centralized theme management with React Context to propagate theme state globally.

    Dynamic DOM manipulation to update HTML classes for theme-based styling.

    A reusable and customizable Toggle Button component for switching themes.

    A clean and visually appealing Card component styled with Tailwind CSS that adapts to the active theme.

    Proper use of React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) for state handling and side effects.

    Accessibility features such as screen-reader-only inputs for the toggle switch.

    Best practices in component design, separation of concerns, and state management.

Whether you want to add dark mode functionality to your project or learn how to leverage React Context for global state, this app is a perfect example to start with.
